## Progress

At the moment, in parallel with the development of game assemblies, version 1.12.2 is being translated, and version 1.16.1 is also planned (but this idea comes immediately after the launch of the current assemblies, because there is no "heavy" content on 1.16.1 yet). The current translation takes about 10-17% of the total text of the project, in the future - when the translations of modifications for the project are over - the modification with translations will be officially published on CurseForge and may even be engaged in translations into foreign languages ​​(multilingual support). To develop a modification-translator, you can go to the Falcion developer page and look at the repository called Amadeus (currently not translated into English).

## Causes

The reasons for this action was that since the popular version 1.7.10 for the CIS there are no proposals in Russian, because an extremely small number of modifications supported the idea of ​​translating 1.12.2 (modern versions from 1.14.4 do not suffer from a lack of translation in the same amount, which is on 1.12.2). Some modifications were translated so that it would be better not to translate at all: others have poor quality, or the pun is lost (or ignored), so we decided to try to translate the necessary modifications and part of the game into Russian on our own.
